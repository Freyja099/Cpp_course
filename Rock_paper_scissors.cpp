// ! don't use string inside switch statement

// ! Without moving srand(time(NULL)) to main(), computer_rand() will reseed the random generator every time itâ€™s called. Since srand() relies on the system clock, calling it repeatedly within a short period might generate the same random numbers. This could make computer_choice seem repetitive or predictable, especially if the calls to computer_rand() are close together in time.

// ! If an invalid input (anything other than 'r', 'p', or 's') is entered, skipping the score display allows the game to continue normally without confusion. Without continue, the loop will still check the winning condition after invalid input, which might seem odd because no round was played.
